# Chatbot

This was a simple chatbot made using C++ for an assignment. The requirement was to implement a bot that answered a user based on keywords.

In terms of Chatbot functionality, the chatbot is responsible for making anime recommendations as well as giving reasons as to why anime is worth watching. Furthermore, it answers the most basic questions about anime like where to watch it, what series to watch, and what anime as a whole is. On the other hand, if you are adverse to anime, it will give you reasons to watch it, and even if you still don’t like it,  recommendations are provided regardless. 

A recommendation kills no one so why not? 

Most answers from the bot don’t exceed more than one sentence as it simply guides the user to the answer. On the other hand, it also contains some sarcastic remarks depending on the choice of the bot.The bot gives random answers through a random generator as long as the given keyword or prompt from the user is detected.  

The bot answers keyword questions like; how, who, what, where, and why, in terms of the basics of anime (eg. why watch anime, where to watch it,  etc.). It doesn’t cover all genres, so it is limited in its knowledge. This is why it will ask if the user has watched anime, and to list them. It will then add it to it’s own list.
